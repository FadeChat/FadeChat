# FadeChat


I have participated in development of messaging application with a colleague from January 2015 to March 2015.

Recently, the public awareness on personal information security has risen in response to instances such as an identity theft. 

Hence we developed the application while focusing mainly on the information security.

We have used AMQP-Protocol to develop the messaging system.

An open-source program – RABBITMQ – has been utilized to make the message sent from the sender disappear after 10 seconds from the moment it has been read depending on the user’s desired setting.


The messages were all indexed then deleted from the message queue as well as from the user’s screen.
